          <p>Hi! I'm Leah. By day, I'm a product photographer for a lamp and lighting company. But by night (and in most of my spare time)...
              I'm currently learning web development!
          </p>
             <p>Born and raised in the foothills of North Carolina, I grew up going to ska and punk shows almost every weekend with friends and worrying my mother by dyeing my hair bright purple.
               Loving the mountains and being outdoors, when college time rolled around I decided on Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina. I earned a BFA in studio art from there and then moved out west to El Paso Texas for a while.
               Now I'm married to an amazing and awesome guy named Preston and we have two crazy corgis. </p> 
               <p>When I'm not learning new coding skills, you can usually find me listening to podcasts about the paranormal or reading a good novel (I know--total nerd!). I am a huge Harry Potter fan, love traveling when I have a chance, and working with polymer clay or embroidery.</p>
